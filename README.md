# BuildGuide
Some mod to project circles and stuff. It can be found over at https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/build-guide.

Make sure to import the Eclipse projects as normal Eclipse projects. Do NOT use in conjunction with Eclipse Buildship, as it will stubbornly purge important configuration files.
